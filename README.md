# NoSQL-Social-Network-API

## Description
This is a backend for a social media platform that allows users to share posts and interact with each other, such as reacting to posts and adding friends. It is built with technologies including Express.js for routing, MongoDB database, and Mongoose ODM to manage the large amount of unstructured data. The API can be tested using a tool called Insomnia, which allows users to see the data in JSON format and perform CRUD operations on users, posts, and reactions.
